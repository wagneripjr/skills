# Signal Detection Patterns

Static analysis detects *structural* test quality. It cannot detect wrong assertions, missing edge cases, or misleading names. The LLM assessment phase addresses those semantic gaps.

## Per-Property Signal Tables

### U -- Understandable

| Signal | Detection Method | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Descriptive test names | Method names contain behavior words: should, when, given, returns, throws, expects | Positive |
| DisplayName/description annotations | @DisplayName, @Description, docstrings on test methods | Positive |
| Nested/grouped organization | @Nested classes, describe/context blocks, test classes per behavior | Positive |
| Arrange-Act-Assert structure | Three distinct blocks: variable declarations, method call, assertion | Positive |
| Comments explaining WHY | Comments preceding assertions or test blocks | Positive |
| Magic numbers in assertions | Numeric literals in assertion arguments without named constants | Negative |
| Cryptic names | test1, test2, testMethod, myTest patterns | Negative |

### M -- Maintainable

| Signal | Detection Method | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Test helper abstractions | Reusable builder/factory patterns in test utilities | Positive |
| Behavior-focused assertions | Asserting on outputs/effects rather than internal state | Positive |
| Reflection usage | Field.setAccessible, getDeclaredField, getDeclaredMethod | Negative |
| Private member access | Testing private/internal methods directly | Negative |
| Implementation coupling | Test imports internal classes rather than public API | Negative |
| Over-specified mock interactions | verify with exact counts, call ordering, verifyNoMoreInteractions (see Mock Anti-Patterns section) | Negative |
| Testing internal details | ArgumentCaptor deep inspection, verify(never()) mirroring branches, type hierarchy assertions, high verify-to-assert ratio (see Mock Anti-Patterns section) | Negative |

### R -- Repeatable

| Signal | Detection Method | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Thread.sleep() calls | Literal pattern match: `Thread.sleep`, `time.sleep`, `sleep(`, `await.*delay`, `setTimeout` | Negative |
| File system operations | File, Path, InputStream, OutputStream, open(), fs.read, os.path | Negative |
| Network calls | HTTP client, socket, URL connection, fetch, requests.get, axios | Negative |
| Database access | Connection, Statement, EntityManager, cursor, session.query | Negative |
| System time dependency | System.currentTimeMillis, LocalDateTime.now, Date(), datetime.now(), Date.now() without injection | Negative |
| Random without seed | Random(), Math.random(), random.random() without deterministic seed | Negative |
| Environment variable reads | System.getenv, os.environ, process.env without mocking | Negative |

### A -- Atomic

| Signal | Detection Method | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh instance per test | Each test creates its own objects; no shared references | Positive |
| Parallelizable | No ordering constraints, no shared state; t.Parallel() in Go | Positive |
| Shared mutable static state | Static fields modified across tests; class-level mutable variables | Negative |
| Test execution ordering | @Order, @FixMethodOrder, @TestMethodOrder, ordered=True | Negative |
| Shared instance state | Instance fields without per-test reset (no @BeforeEach reinit) | Negative |
| Complex setUp/tearDown | Extensive setup suggesting shared dependencies; >15 lines in setup | Negative |

### N -- Necessary

| Signal | Detection Method | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Parameterized tests | @ParameterizedTest, @Theory, pytest.mark.parametrize, test.each, table-driven tests | Positive |
| Redundant test methods | Multiple tests with identical assertion patterns on same method | Negative |
| Trivial assertions | assertTrue(true), assertNotNull on constructor, expect(1).toBe(1) (see Tautology Theatre section) | Negative |
| Framework testing | Tests that verify language/framework behavior, not application code (see Tautology Theatre section) | Negative |
| Ignored/disabled tests | @Ignore, @Disabled, @Skip, pytest.mark.skip, it.skip, t.Skip | Negative |
| Empty test bodies | Test methods with no executable statements | Negative |
| Mock tautology | Mock return value configured then asserted on the same mock with no production code in between (see Tautology Theatre section) | Negative |
| No production code exercised | All objects in test are mocks; no real class instantiated or invoked (see Tautology Theatre section) | Negative |

### G -- Granular

| Signal | Detection Method | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Single logical assertion | One assertion or multiple assertions verifying one outcome | Positive |
| Multiple unrelated assertions | >1 assertion per test verifying different behaviors | Negative |
| Assertion count | Raw count of assert* calls per test method (metric, not direct signal) | Metric |
| Multi-behavior names | Test method name suggests multiple behaviors: And, Also, Then (in middle of name) | Negative |
| Mega-tests | >20 lines in test body or >5 assertions | Negative |

### F -- Fast

| Signal | Detection Method | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Pure computation | No I/O, no external dependencies in test body | Positive |
| Thread.sleep() | Same as Repeatable -- also impacts speed | Negative |
| File I/O | File system access in test body | Negative |
| Network calls | HTTP/socket usage in test body | Negative |
| Database access | JDBC/ORM operations in test body | Negative |
| Large inline test data | Inline datasets >50 lines in test method | Negative |

### T -- First (TDD Evidence)

| Signal | Detection Method | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Behavior-driven naming | Tests named for behaviors: shouldX, whenX_thenY, given_when_then | Positive |
| Test structure drives API | Tests exercise public API, not implementation paths | Positive |
| Arrange-Act-Assert clarity | Clean AAA structure suggests specification-first thinking | Positive |
| Tests mirror implementation | Test class hierarchy mirrors production class hierarchy exactly | Negative |
| Coverage patches | Tests that only cover exception paths or edge cases added later | Negative |

Future enhancement: git history analysis (test files committed before/alongside production files) would strengthen T scoring. Feasible via `git log` within the agent.

## Tautology Theatre

Tests whose outcome is predetermined by their own setup, independent of production code. The defining test: **"Would this test still pass if all production code were deleted?"** If yes, it is tautology theatre.

Tautology theatre is the umbrella term for four types of valueless tests:

| Type | Severity | Description | Affects | Requires Mocks? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mock Tautology** | Critical | Configures a mock return value, then asserts the mock returns it (AP1 below) | N, M | Yes |
| **Mock-Only Test** | Critical | Every object is a mock; no real class instantiated or invoked (AP2 below) | N, M, T | Yes |
| **Trivial Tautology** | Medium | Assertions that are always true: `assertTrue(true)`, `assertEquals(1, 1)`, `assertNotNull(new Object())` | N | No |
| **Framework Test** | Medium | Verifies language or framework behavior, not application code: `assertNotNull(mock(Foo.class))`, `assertTrue("hello".contains("ell"))` | N | No |

All four types share the property that they provide zero verification of production behaviour and create false confidence in test coverage. Trivial Tautology and Framework Test can appear in any test suite, regardless of whether mocking is used. Mock Tautology and Mock-Only Test are specific to test suites that use mocking frameworks.

Detection patterns for Mock Tautology and Mock-Only Test are detailed in the Mock Anti-Patterns section below. Detection patterns for Trivial Tautology and Framework Test are in the per-property signal tables (N -- Necessary) and the language-specific detection patterns.

### Trivial Tautology Detection

| Language | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Java | `assertTrue\(true\)`, `assertFalse\(false\)`, `assertEquals\(\d+,\s*\d+\)` (same literal both sides), `assertNotNull\(new \w+\(` | `assertTrue(true)`, `assertEquals(1, 1)`, `assertNotNull(new Object())` |
| Python | `assert\s+True`, `assert\s+1\s*==\s*1`, `self\.assertTrue\(True\)`, `assertIsNotNone\(\w+\(\)\)` where arg is a constructor | `assert True`, `self.assertEqual(1, 1)` |
| JavaScript | `expect\(true\)\.toBe\(true\)`, `expect\(1\)\.toBe\(1\)`, `expect\(.*\)\.toBeTruthy\(\)` on literal | `expect(true).toBe(true)`, `expect(1).toBe(1)` |
| Go | `assert\.True\(t,\s*true\)`, `assert\.Equal\(t,\s*(\d+),\s*\1\)` | `assert.True(t, true)`, `assert.Equal(t, 1, 1)` |
| C# | `Assert\.IsTrue\(true\)`, `Assert\.AreEqual\(\d+,\s*\d+\)` (same literal), `Assert\.IsNotNull\(new ` | `Assert.IsTrue(true)`, `Assert.AreEqual(1, 1)` |

### Framework Test Detection

A test is a framework test when it asserts on the return value of a framework method with no application code involved. Common patterns:

| Language | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Java | `assertNotNull\(mock\(` or `assertNotNull\(Mockito\.mock\(`, assertions on `Collections.empty*`, `Optional.empty()` | `assertNotNull(mock(Foo.class))` |
| Python | Assertions on `Mock()`, `MagicMock()`, `patch()` return values directly | `assertIsNotNone(Mock())` |
| JavaScript | `expect(jest.fn()).toBeDefined()`, assertions on framework utilities | `expect(jest.fn()).toBeDefined()` |
| Go | Assertions on `new(MockFoo)` directly | `assert.NotNil(t, new(MockFoo))` |
| C# | `Assert.IsNotNull(new Mock<IFoo>())`, assertions on `Substitute.For<>()` | `Assert.IsNotNull(new Mock<IFoo>())` |

## Mock Anti-Patterns

Tests that use mocking frameworks can appear structurally perfect (clean naming, single assertion, no I/O) while providing zero value. Mock Tautology (AP1) and Mock-Only Test (AP2) are part of the broader Tautology Theatre family (see above). Over-specified interactions (AP3) and Testing Internal Details (AP4) are not tautologies -- they do test production code, but they test HOW it works rather than WHAT it achieves, making them brittle. No mainstream static analysis tool (SonarQube, PMD, ESLint, tsDetect, testsmells.org) has rules for these patterns as of 2026.

### AP1 -- Mock Tautology (Severity: Critical)

A test that configures a mock's return value and then asserts that the same mock returns that value, with no production code in between. Logically equivalent to `x = 5; assert x == 5`.

**Affects**: N (Necessary) primary, M (Maintainable) secondary

**Detection heuristic**: The same mock object that has its return value configured is also the object whose return value is asserted, with no real class instantiation between setup and assertion.

| Language | Mock Setup Pattern | Assert Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Java (Mockito) | `when(\w+\.\w+\(.*?\))\.thenReturn\(\w+\)` | `assertEquals` on same mock's method return |
| Python (unittest.mock) | `(\w+)\.(\w+)\.return_value\s*=\s*(\w+)` | `assert \1.\2(...) == \3` or `assertEqual(\3, \1.\2(...))` |
| Python (pytest-mock) | `mocker\.Mock\(\)` with `.return_value =` | same as unittest.mock |
| JavaScript (Jest) | `jest\.fn\(\)\.mockReturnValue\(` | `expect(mock.method(...)).toEqual(value)` |
| JavaScript (Sinon) | `sinon\.stub\(\)\.returns\(` | `assert.deepEqual(mock.method(...), value)` |
| Go (testify) | `(\w+)\.On\("\w+".*\)\.Return\(\w+` | `assert.Equal(t, value, mock.Method(...))` |
| Go (gomock) | `(\w+)\.EXPECT\(\)\.\w+\(.*\)\.Return\(\w+` | `assert.Equal` on same mock's method return |
| C# (Moq) | `(\w+)\.Setup\(.*\)\.Returns\(\w+\)` | `Assert.*(\w+\.Object\.\w+\()` |
| C# (NSubstitute) | `(\w+)\.\w+\(.*\)\.Returns\(\w+\)` | `Assert.*(\1\.\w+\()` |

**Key discriminator**: If a production class is instantiated between mock setup and assertion (`new RealClass(mock)` or equivalent), it is NOT a tautology.

### AP2 -- No Production Code Exercised (Severity: Critical)

A test where every object is a mock/stub/fake and no real class is instantiated or invoked. The test exercises only mock framework machinery. Superset of AP1: all mock tautologies have no production code, but AP2 also includes verify-only tests.

**Affects**: N (Necessary) primary, M (Maintainable) secondary, T (First) secondary

**Detection heuristic**: Test method contains mock creation and assertions/verifications, but no instantiation of a non-mock class.

| Language | Mock Creation Indicator | Production Code Indicator (absence = flag) |
|---|---|---|
| Java (Mockito) | `mock\(\w+\.class\)`, `@Mock`, `Mockito\.(mock\|spy)\(` | `new [^M]\w+\(` (new non-Mock class) |
| Python | `Mock\(`, `MagicMock\(`, `patch\(`, `mocker\.(Mock\|patch)` | Any class instantiation that is not Mock/MagicMock/patch |
| JavaScript (Jest) | `jest\.fn\(`, `jest\.mock\(`, `jest\.spyOn\(` | `new \w+\(` (new real class) |
| JavaScript (Sinon) | `sinon\.(stub\|spy\|mock)\(` | `new \w+\(` |
| Go (testify) | `new\(Mock\w+\)` | `\w+\{` or `New\w+\(` (non-mock struct literal or constructor) |
| Go (gomock) | `NewMock\w+\(` | non-mock struct literal or constructor |
| C# (Moq) | `new Mock<`, `Mock\.Of<` | `new [^M]\w+\(` |
| C# (NSubstitute) | `Substitute\.For<` | `new \w+\(` |

**False positive mitigation**: Tests where the SUT is injected via `setUp`/`@BeforeEach`/`beforeEach` are not flagged -- check setup methods for production class instantiation before flagging.

### AP3 -- Over-Specified Mock Interactions (Severity: High)

Tests that use verify() with exact call counts, strict argument matchers, and/or call ordering constraints. Tests describe HOW the software works rather than WHAT it achieves. Any behaviour-preserving refactoring breaks them.

**Affects**: M (Maintainable) primary, A (Atomic) secondary

**Severity tiers within AP3**:

| Signal | Severity | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Exact call count: `verify(mock, times(N))` | Medium | Couples to implementation call count |
| Call ordering: `InOrder`, `callOrder`, `gomock.InOrder` | High | Ordering is almost always an implementation detail |
| No more interactions: `verifyNoMoreInteractions`, `VerifyNoOtherCalls` | High | Prevents any future internal changes |
| Exact argument matching on >3 fields via argThat/MatchedBy | Medium | Over-constrains the interaction contract |

| Language | Exact Count | Ordering | No More Interactions |
|---|---|---|---|
| Java (Mockito) | `verify\(\w+,\s*times\(\d+\)\)` | `InOrder\s+\w+\s*=\s*inOrder\(` | `verifyNoMoreInteractions\(` |
| Python | `assert_called_once\(`, `assert_called_once_with\(`, `.call_count\s*==`, `assertEqual\(\w+\.call_count` | `assert_has_calls\(.*any_order\s*=\s*False` | -- |
| JavaScript (Jest) | `toHaveBeenCalledTimes\(\d+\)` | `.mock\.invocationCallOrder` | -- |
| JavaScript (Sinon) | `calledOnce`, `calledTwice`, `callCount` | `sinon\.assert\.callOrder\(` | -- |
| Go (testify) | `.Once\(\)`, `.Times\(\d+\)`, `AssertNumberOfCalls\(` | -- | `AssertExpectations\(` (when all On() use .Once/.Times) |
| Go (gomock) | `.Times\(\d+\)` | `gomock\.InOrder\(` | -- |
| C# (Moq) | `Times\.(Exactly\|Once\|AtMostOnce)\(` | `MockSequence` | `VerifyNoOtherCalls\(\)` |
| C# (NSubstitute) | `.Received\(\d+\)\.` | -- | -- |

**Note**: Simple `verify(mock).method()` without `times()` is NOT flagged -- verifying a side effect occurred is legitimate. Only exact counts, ordering, and exhaustive checks are signals.

### AP4 -- Testing Internal Details (Severity: High)

Tests coupled to implementation through mechanisms subtler than reflection: ArgumentCaptor deep inspection, verify(never()) mirroring control flow branches, type hierarchy assertions, and high verify-to-assert ratios. These tests break on behaviour-preserving refactorings.

**Affects**: M (Maintainable) primary, U (Understandable) secondary

**Composite signals** (flag when 2+ present in a single test method):

| Signal | Weight | Detection |
|---|---|---|
| ArgumentCaptor / call_args deep inspection | 3 | Captor capture + getter chain on captured value |
| Call ordering verification (InOrder) | 3 | Same patterns as AP3 ordering |
| verify(never()) paired with verify() | 2 | `never()` in same test that has other verify() calls |
| Type checking assertions | 2 | `instanceof`, `IsAssignableFrom`, `assertIsInstance`, `toBeInstanceOf` |
| Internal property access on captured args | 2 | Underscore-prefixed properties (`._field`), `.internal.` imports |
| High verify-to-assert ratio (>3:1) | 1 | Count verify/Received/AssertCalled vs assertEquals/assertTrue/expect().toBe |

| Language | ArgumentCaptor / call_args | verify(never()) | Type Check |
|---|---|---|---|
| Java (Mockito) | `ArgumentCaptor<\w+>.*forClass` + `captor\.getValue\(\)\.get` | `verify\(\w+,\s*never\(\)\)` | `instanceof` in assertion |
| Python | `.call_args\[` + property access on captured value | `assert_not_called\(\)` | `assertIsInstance\(`, `assert isinstance\(` |
| JavaScript (Jest) | `.mock\.calls\[\d+\]\[\d+\]\.` (deep property access) | `not\.toHaveBeenCalled\(\)` | `toBeInstanceOf\(` |
| JavaScript (Sinon) | `.args\[\d+\]\[\d+\]\.` | `notCalled` | -- |
| Go (testify) | `mock\.MatchedBy\(func.*\{` with deep field access | `AssertNotCalled\(` | type assertions `\.\(\*?\w+\)` |
| Go (gomock) | -- (gomock lacks argument captors) | -- | type assertions |
| C# (Moq) | `It\.Is<\w+>\(.*=>.*\.` (deep lambda inspection) | `Times\.Never` | `Assert\.IsAssignableFrom<`, `Assert\.IsType<` |
| C# (NSubstitute) | `Arg\.Is<\w+>\(.*=>` | `.DidNotReceive\(\)\.` | `Assert\.IsAssignableFrom<` |

## Detection Priorities

When analyzing a test file, collect signals in this order (most impactful first):

1. **Identify language and framework** from imports/annotations (including mocking framework)
2. **Count test methods** (denominators for density calculations)
3. **Scan for high-severity negatives**: sleep, reflection, shared static state, ordering annotations
4. **Scan for mock anti-patterns** (AP1-AP4): mock tautologies, no production code exercised, over-specified interactions, internal detail testing
5. **Count assertions per test method** (G scoring)
6. **Analyze naming patterns** (U, T scoring)
7. **Check for organizational structure** (nested classes, describe blocks)
8. **Scan for I/O patterns** (R, F scoring)
9. **Identify positive patterns** (parameterized tests, builders, parallel markers)

## Signal Overlap

Some signals affect multiple properties. When a signal is detected, attribute it to all relevant properties:

| Signal | Properties Affected |
|---|---|
| Thread.sleep() | R (negative), F (negative) |
| File I/O | R (negative), F (negative) |
| Network calls | R (negative), F (negative) |
| Behavior-driven naming | U (positive), T (positive) |
| Arrange-Act-Assert | U (positive), T (positive) |
| Shared static state | A (negative), R (negative) |
