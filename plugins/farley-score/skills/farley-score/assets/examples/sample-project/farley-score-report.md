### Tautology Theatre Analysis

Tests whose outcome is predetermined by their own setup, independent of production code. The defining test: "Would this test still pass if all production code were deleted?" If yes, it is tautology theatre.

#### Mock Tautologies

Configures a mock return value, then asserts that the mock returns it, with no production code in between.

| # | Test Method | Line | Mock Setup | Assertion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | test_mock_returns_configured_value | test_calculator.py:93 | `mock_calc.add.return_value = 42` | `assertEqual(result, 42)` |

#### Mock-Only Tests

Every object in the test is a mock; no real class is instantiated or invoked.

| # | Test Method | Line | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | test_mock_only_no_real_code | test_user_service.py:80 | `mock_service = MagicMock()` -- no UserService instantiated; asserts mock return value and mock call count |

#### Trivial Tautologies

Assertions that are always true regardless of any code: `assertTrue(true)`, `assertEqual(1, 1)`.

| # | Test Method | Line | Assertion |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | test_true_is_true | test_calculator.py:61 | `self.assertTrue(True)` |
| 2 | test_one_equals_one | test_calculator.py:64 | `self.assertEqual(1, 1)` |

#### Framework Tests

Tests that verify language or framework behavior, not application code.

| # | Test Method | Line | Assertion | What It Actually Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | test_python_addition | test_calculator.py:101 | `assertEqual(2 + 2, 4)` | Python's `+` operator on integers |
| 2 | test_python_string_methods | test_calculator.py:104 | `assertEqual("hello".upper(), "HELLO")` | Python's `str.upper()` method |

#### Tautology Theatre Summary

**6** tautology theatre instances across **6** of **21** test methods: 1 mock tautology, 1 mock-only test, 2 trivial tautologies, 2 framework tests. These 6 tests (29% of the suite) provide zero verification of production behaviour and create false confidence in test coverage.

### Top 5 Worst Offenders

1. **test_user_service.py:80** `test_mock_only_no_real_code` -- ~2.5/10 -- Mock-only AP2; no production code exercised; every object is a MagicMock; would still pass if UserService were deleted
2. **test_calculator.py:93** `test_mock_returns_configured_value` -- ~3.0/10 -- Mock tautology AP1; configures `mock_calc.add.return_value = 42` then asserts `result == 42`; logically equivalent to `x = 42; assert x == 42`
3. **test_calculator.py:61** `test_true_is_true` -- ~3.0/10 -- Trivial tautology; `assertTrue(True)` can never fail; zero value; affects Necessary and First
4. **test_calculator.py:49** `test_all_operations` -- ~3.5/10 -- Mega-test with 6 assertions across add, subtract, multiply, divide, history count, and clear; not Granular; failure doesn't pinpoint the issue
5. **test_user_service.py:66** `test_register_calls_everything_in_order` -- ~4.0/10 -- Over-specified AP3; verifies exact call counts and call ordering through an attached parent mock; any behaviour-preserving refactoring breaks this test

### Recommendations

1. **Remove tautology theatre (N=2.5, weight 1.0x)**: Delete or replace the 6 tests that add zero value. The 2 trivial tautologies (`assertTrue(True)`, `assertEqual(1, 1)`), 2 framework tests (`2 + 2`, `"hello".upper()`), mock tautology, and mock-only test provide no production code verification. Replace with behaviour-focused tests that exercise real Calculator and UserService instances.

2. **Fix mock anti-patterns to improve Maintainable (M=4.5, weight 1.5x)**: Replace `test_register_calls_everything_in_order` with a test that verifies the *outcome* (user saved, email sent) rather than the *call sequence*. Replace `test_deactivate_sets_active_false` with a test that verifies deactivation through the public API rather than inspecting internal `call_args` state.

3. **Improve test naming for Understandable (U=4.9, weight 1.5x)**: Rename cryptic tests using the `test_should_[action]_[condition]` pattern. For example, rename `test_it_works` to `test_should_return_only_active_users`. This also improves First/TDD (T) since behaviour-driven names are a strong TDD signal.

4. **Eliminate shared mutable state (A=7.6, R=7.5)**: Replace the class-level `shared_calc = Calculator()` with per-test instances. `test_shared_state_history` currently depends on `test_shared_state_add` running first -- this violates both Atomic and Repeatable.

5. **Split the mega-test (G=7.1)**: Break `test_all_operations` into individual tests: `test_should_add`, `test_should_subtract`, `test_should_multiply`, `test_should_divide`, `test_should_track_history`, `test_should_clear_history`. Each tests one behaviour with one assertion.

### Methodology Notes

- Static/LLM blend: 60/40
- LLM model: claude-opus-4-6
- Files analyzed: 2 (no sampling -- under 50-file threshold)
- Test methods analyzed: 21
- Language: Python 3
- Framework: unittest, unittest.mock (MagicMock)
- T (First/TDD) scoring note: Static evidence for TDD is indirect; LLM judgment weighted more heavily for this property based on naming patterns, AAA structure, and API-focused test design
- Note: This sample project contains deliberately mixed-quality tests (7 good, 14 bad) designed to demonstrate the Farley Score methodology
