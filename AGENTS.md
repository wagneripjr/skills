# AI Coding Agent Instructions

This project uses CLAUDE.md files as the single source of truth for all AI coding instructions.

Read these instruction files in order (later files take precedence):
1. **Global preferences**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — User-wide coding standards, tool routing, and patterns
2. **Project instructions**: `CLAUDE.md` — Project-specific structure, stack, commands, and conventions
